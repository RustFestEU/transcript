Hi, my name is Robert from Ethcore.
It's not so often that an event like this comes around and we are really glad.
Hello.
Ah.
Perfect.
First, I want to give you an idea of what we're all about.

So, we are a team of mathematicians, computer scientists, and experts.
We're working on building a future: Our pure Rust implementation of Etherium.
So if you're not familiar -- this is much more than a payments platform.
It allows you to deploy arbitrary programs, which could be executed by the transaction, and correct and predictable execution is part of the state transition.
So this is immensely more power than the blockchains you may be familiar with.
While Ethcore come up with the theorem, Rust has enabled us to come up with the easy implementation of this.

 I'm guessing most of you are not here because of Crypto or Blockchain.
Before I was working on Blockchain and Crypto currency I'd been a Rust enthusiast the past three years or so.
This is important for me to be here.
Now, one of the things that has brought us all here today is the language, even more so, it's the desire to build something new and build something better.

That's one of the reasons I'm so excited about the Ethcore platform, we're building financial technology using a next Generation programming language.
Now, the ideals of safety, of speed, of concurrency are really important when you're writing something that has to be fast and has a lot value at stake.
So today, Parity is one of the largest Rust repositories on GitHub, excluding the Rust compiler itself and the Servo browser.
We've been developing it the last 10 months, and tomorrow we'll be hosting the workshop in the Crypto and BlockChain room where we want to share with you the lessons we have learned over this period.

So we'll be talking about BlockChain clients, how Parity works or, you know, just any kind of Block Chain related questions and we have got a table set set up over there for the rest of the conference if you have any questions.
Come on by, and enjoy the rest of RustFest!
