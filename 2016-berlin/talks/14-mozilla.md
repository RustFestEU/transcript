>> Hi,en, I'm Steve, I'm here to represent Mozilla.
You know us as the fine finest purhave aers of -- ervayors of human interface us.
It's someone who has been in technology.
Using fire fox.
I remember fire fox.
And if you would told me then, you'd work for the same organize.
I'm really happy to work on Mozilla.
I'm going to use this next five minutes to talk about other stuff.
As a member of the Rust community team, there's been a lot of really interesting new projects that of course happening.
I originally started the community team, but Steve doesn't scale.
So I've been focusing on docs and Eric has picked up the slack there and has been doing wonderful things.
Tomorrow we're going to have the first ever Rust ridge workshop.
I come from Ruby rails and railsridge, moving intoxicator languages so we're hoping to run workshops all over the world and teach people how to program and teach them Rust.
And collecting community resources, helping others run great community-run conferences like this one and put on, things so I think one of Rust's strongest selling points is a community.
They're all wonderful people.
And thank you much for coming if you see me, feel free to come ask me.
