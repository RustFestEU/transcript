>> RYAN: Hello.
I'm a Microsoft employee.
Crazy.
Wasn't that guy the M.C.? Yeah, I wanted to talk about Microsoft in general, a little bit about Microsoft here in Berlin, for the people that are in the German area and throughout Europe that maybe would want to come work here and talk about open source at Microsoft, which is still something that a lot people, including myself are getting used to and touch on those topics, and if you want to talk to me later about any specifics about Microsoft, then feel free T.
I would be happy to talk to you about it.
My personal story is that I work for a small Berlin company and made an app called wonders and it was purchased by Microsoft so I'm new as well.

It's been about a year now.
I'm starting to learn my ropes but I definitely have seen many sides of Microsoft.
One thing I wanted to show, I don't know if everybody saw this.
This is from GitHub Universe and Microsoft organization is the number 1:00 over open source on GitHub, which is just fascinating.
If you would have told anybody in this room 10 years ago, they would of course very, very surprised.
But the cool thing, it's becoming less and Les surprising every time, I see something like that.
Microsoft and open source are hand in hand together and there are many times I've gone to the Seattle team and they were full time on open source.
Everything they do is out in the open and interesting as well, they don't work on windows.
So there's a lot Linux hackers and things like that will so it's sort of, I don't know, not what you would have thought of 10 years ago for Microsoft.



Here in Berlin, we have a couple of teams that are working on various products.
One of them wonders and we have a couple of people from the wonders teams here.
Yeah.
Cool.
We have got a couple people here.
And I'm working on another project as well.
I should just mention briefly, we are hiring for both teams and we're looking to expand the office here in beer lip as well to be much larger than it is now.
So if you're ever interested if opportunities there.
I'd also be happy to talk about those.
I also want to talk about the ability of Rust at Microsoft as well.
It's something I'm very passionate B and it's a really cool thing to work for a big company that has a lot of sway in the 43.
I have this fantasy of one day writing that block post like we just employed this massive product out.
And it's written entirely in Rust and that would be awesome.
One problems I'm working on right now is sharing code with Rust.
We have a lot of shared sequence C++ code, for instance, and it would be really cool if we could move some of that to Rust instead.
I believe, Excel finally got rid of all of its if-line assembly, and is now using C++ spiral, which is good.
If you're interested in talking about that, how someone can share code, between different platforms, IOS, android, Mac and windows as well.
To share a logic between apps, I would definitely be interested in talk to you about that tomorrow in a workshop.
We can sit down and hack some stuff together.
So that's all have I to say.
If you have any questions, and are interested in learning anything about sort of the way that open source works at Microsoft now days, come catch me sometime.
So thank you.
