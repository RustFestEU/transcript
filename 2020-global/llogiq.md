**RustFest Global 2020 Speaker Introductions**

**keen** is, as the name implicates  
very keen on how he creates  
with code many kind  
of lisps and behind  
all this are, well, some Rusty crates

**Yousuke Onoue** will teach  
a way the Rust language can reach  
the web, so assemble  
make JavaScript tremble  
and onwards go into the breach

**Tomohiro Kato** does try  
to get a Rust-based A.I.  
into chips to embed  
to get stuff on the net  
here's hope that the circuits won't fry

**Aki** has the unbreakable will  
to get Rust to the metal, to mill  
it into shapes snappy  
make customers happy  
though this battle is somewhat uphill

**Tarun** helpfully teaches Rust  
to newbies who start out and must  
learn the concepts, the tools  
and the various rules  
until their own experience they trust

**Zac Burns** wants to serialize  
some ideas that we all won't despise  
into one talk to make  
us see what it will take  
to make code easier to realize

**Jin Mingjian** uses Rust to enhance  
some database apps' performance  
as he breaks apart  
the state of the art  
to make hashtables and b-trees dance

ðŸž±ðŸž±ðŸž±

**Nikita** makes Rust interactive  
so if learning it is your directive  
you won't need to fight  
to see what's inside  
to become a debugging detective

**AÃ¯ssata Maiga** lets me know  
how to make bots without Arduino  
writing Rust to move  
her bot to my groove  
Sure there will be some cool stuff to see, no?

**Daan and Diane** get us to the hype  
Of keeping secrets in a type  
Disallowing creation  
of some optimization  
that just might tell the feds what you type

**Gavin and Matthijs** show how one might  
a large project in Rust rewrite  
start out small, let it grow  
until stealing the show  
from whatever was there before, right?

**Vivian** wants us to be safe  
and our code on the web to behave  
use Rust to generate  
code that will validate  
risky inputs, no need to be brave

Miri ist Rust's interpreter  
And **Christian** will gladly debate'er  
On how to bequeath  
her the stuff underneath  
so she can run until much later

**Anastasia** plays Rust like a flute  
or maybe a magical lute  
to then simulate  
things that art may create  
and this art does really compute

**Stefan** gives us three steps to learn Rust  
Not saying that follow you must,  
but if humble you are  
with Rust you'll go far  
as you learn the compiler to trust

**Glowcoil** shows how vectors can act  
to create a great UI, in fact  
they are easy to do  
on a slow GPU  
and they won't fall together when stacked

**Sean Chen** wants to show the appeal  
of nicely with errors to deal  
seeing rustc's example  
there really are ample  
suggestions you really should steal

**Max Orok** shows science, not fiction  
and Rust ain't no contradiction  
it sure won't spill your beans,  
so use it by all means  
if permitted by your jurisdiction

**Carlo Supina and Micah** strive  
left for dead Rust projects to revive  
by making it dress  
up with an ECS  
now it's perfectly looking alive.

**Andrew Dona-Couch** will now go  
to the farthest reach of Rust to show  
if you're willing to get  
your coding feet wet  
Tier three has got some room to grow

**Colton Donelly** takes Rust to school  
to show freshmen the language is cool  
and capable, fun  
great to fail or to run  
all in all it's a great teaching tool
